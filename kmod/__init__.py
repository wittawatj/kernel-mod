# This provides kmod.data which is identical to kgof.data.
# But it semms "import kmod.data" does not work. Only "from kmod import data"
# works. I do not know why.

# Require the kgof package
# https://github.com/wittawatj/kernel-gof
#from kgof import data
from kgof import density
from kgof import kernel
# from kgof import util
